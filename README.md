# Eutopian AI Knowledge Base ðŸŒŸ

## Vision
Eutopian AI aims to help humanity move towards Eutopia through better AI interactions. We believe that an Open Source AI filled with eutopian principles can help solve real world problems better than compromised systems ever could. 
The output of AI is only as good as its input - and that input should serve humanity's highest potential, not corporate interests or dystopian agendas. 

## About
This knowledge base documents ways to guide AI towards true knowledge, truly positive solutions, and ethical frameworks that serve the highest good for all. 
We overcome built-in limitations through:

- Net Positive Problem Solving
- Unbiased Information
- Evidence-Based Solutions
- Collective Wisdom
